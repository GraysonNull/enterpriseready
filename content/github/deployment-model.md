GitHub offers their application to customers with a few different deployment options. The vast majority of GitHub's customers run on GitHub.com (in terms of quantity, but not necessarily in terms of revenue), this is the multi-tenant, cloud hosted version of their application. [Individuals sign up for accounts](../blog/user-centric-v-team-centric) and then are added to organizations when they join a new company. Organizations will generally have a mix of private and public repos with varying access based on the users role. The easy of using GitHub.com for open source and personal projects is often attributed with the success of the "bottom up" adoption that GitHub has seen in enterprises.

GitHub also offers customers the option of running their application as a private instance with [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com/). The buyer is responsible for installing and managing their instance of GitHub Enterprise (unless they work with a managed service provider) as an [AMI on AWS](https://enterprise.github.com/aws), a [VM in Azure](https://enterprise.github.com/microsoft/) or as a .OVA in their own data center. GitHub has done an outstanding job of creating an experience that makes the setup and maintenance of the application feel as easy as managing a SaaS application.

## Getting started with GHE:
Sign up for a trial online (this was actually a very novel idea that you could self-serve a trial of an enterprise installable version of application.)

GitHub provides several ways to get started, either through their downloadable OVA or with a public cloud image.
