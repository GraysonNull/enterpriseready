[Box](https://box.com) is a file sharing and collaboration tool that has built its business on enabling enterprise companies to transition away from legacy shared drive systems, to the cloud-hosted Box platform. Along the way Box has faced a never-ending string of objections from potential buyers in the areas of security. As a result, Box has continued to create demonstrable security practices and the marketing campaigns to promote their objectives.

Box focuses heavily on Security as a core feature of their product, this can be seen clearly in their [security page](https://box.com/security):
